Multitasking enhancer blah blah blah

Depiction (and some more info): http://elijahandandrew.com/repo/depictions/ReachApp/
See the /wiki for some code tutorials.

Features:
- Multitasking in Reachability (ReachApp)
- iOS 9-like "slide over" (SwipeOver)
- MissionControl with multiple desktops (Mission Control)
- Windowed multitasking (Empoleon)
- NC app (Quick Access)
- backgrounder-like features (Aura)


There is a full public api (as opposed to the private/interval api and headers) that allows anyone to create addons, widgets, and tweaks (Tweakception!) for Multiplexer. 
The public api can be found in public_api. This api is less likely to change or be removed as opposed to the other headers and stuff.
For the end user's ease of use, please register your extensions with -[Multiplexer registerExtension:forMultiplexerVersion:]. I hope to also provide api requirements, etc at some point.

Currently it is only compatible with iOS 8, however some measures have been taken to ease the process of making it compatible with other iOS editions (whether future or past).
There are some "options" or features that are in here but are disabled or otherwise removed because either they don't work or there's no point having them.
