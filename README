Puts the last used app (or NC) in the Reachability view. 
Now with more features!
- SwipeOver apps with vertical screen splitting and scaled previews

Depiction (and some more info): http://elijahandandrew.com/repo/depictions/ReachApp/

Known issues / TODO:
- Better keyboard support (force app to some sort of temporary fullscreen like the iOS 9 swipeover keyboard?)
- Landscape (l/r/upside down) support for SwipeOver
???? Some sort of windowed multitasking with a "Mission Control", "LaunchPad", "Dock (incl. running apps)", and separate desktops
