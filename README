Puts the last used app (or NC) in the Reachability view

Depiction (and some more info): http://elijahandandrew.com/repo/depictions/ReachApp/

Known issues / TODO: 
• NC view doesn't show after opening the NC normally
• UIWindows (apps) may be placed incorrectly
• UIWindows (apps) may not rotation or resize correctly
• Keyboard doesn't resize
• Root apps don't show
• Practically everything else
• Landscape right support
• Upside down support (maybe)
√ Properly (or a better fake way) un-background apps 
• Flipswitch 
• this will expand later
